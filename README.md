This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl when modifying an array while iterating over it using a traditional for loop and index.  The `unshift` function changes the array's size, leading to incorrect indexing and potentially unexpected results, such as skipping elements or accessing elements outside the array's bounds. The solution shows a safer method using a `foreach` loop or iterating backward.
